  The video-player component
  --------------------------

  As we continue to work on Video Vault we'll want a lot of control over the
  interactions of the video player. Because of this, we'll create a new
  component called video-player.

  The first bit of additional UI we'll add is an obvious way to exit the video:
  an X button in the top right that takes us back to the movie route.

  Render the new video-player component inside of your play template. At this
  point all of the previous tests should continue to pass. Add the class
  'video-player' to your component to take advantage of the provided CSS
  styles.

  Next you should render the X button inside of video-player component. The
  markup should look like this:

    <button class="video-player__close">Ã—</button>

  When the user clicks on this element you should send an "onClose" action which will
  send the user back to the movie route.
